# Tensorflow
- An interface for expressing machine learning algorithms and an implementation for executing such algotithms
- A framework for creating ensemble algorithms for today's most challenging problems

# Tensorflow Architecture 
- Lower level library 
- predefined implementation 
- scales up and down
- deployment to production

## Language Inteface
- Python 
- C++

## Execution environment 
- Execution master

## Why is it called tensor flow 
- Tensor is n-dimensional structure (arrays etc)
