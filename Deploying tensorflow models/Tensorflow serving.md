# Tensorflow Serving
## Machine Learning Workflow
- Collect data 
- Train Model
- Deploy and host model
### Data from many sources
### Clean the data
### Standardize and Normalize
### pre process and transform 

## Train Model
### Apply ML algos
### Export model parameters
- Save model is a language neutral interface to serialize TF models
# Deploy and host the model
- Use TF model server
- HTTP endpoints
- gRPC or googles RPC to get the models predictions 
- Use protocol buffers to communicate

# Demo to build a model 
- Use a built-in estimator 
### DNNClassifier

- cd datasets wher you have the training data stored
- ChurnModelling.csv
#### less command to examine the model 
- Start a jupyter notebook instance
